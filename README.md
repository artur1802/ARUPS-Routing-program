# ARUPS-Routing-program
:Brief Description: Developed an algorithm and software solution to optimize delivery routes for local deliveries, ensuring all packages are delivered on time while keeping the total distance traveled under 140 miles.
Technologies Used: Python, Data Structures (Hash Tables), Algorithms (Nearest Neighbor Algorithm), datetime library.

•	Efficient Routing: Implemented the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between delivery locations, optimizing the routes for three trucks.
•	Constraints Handling: Designed the system to handle specific delivery constraints and requirements, such as unique package criteria and time-sensitive address corrections.
•	Progress Tracking: Included features to monitor the progress of each truck and package delivery in real-time, providing detailed updates based on various package attributes.
•	Outcome: Successfully created a routing solution that ensures all 40 packages are delivered within the constraints, with a total travel distance under 140 miles.
