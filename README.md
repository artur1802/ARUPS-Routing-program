ARUPS Routing Program

Overview
The WGUPS Routing Program is designed to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) daily local deliveries. This program ensures that all packages are delivered on time while meeting specific delivery requirements and keeping the total distance traveled under 140 miles for all trucks.

Features
Custom hash table for managing package data.
Optimized delivery algorithm for route planning.
Command-line interface for real-time package status updates.
Handles dynamic delivery constraints and updates.

Technologies Used
Python

How to Run
To run the program, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python main.py

What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained significant experience in the following areas:

Algorithm Design: Developed and implemented a delivery routing algorithm that efficiently meets all delivery constraints.
Data Structures: Created a custom hash table to manage and retrieve package data efficiently.
Python Programming: Enhanced my skills in Python, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
Problem-Solving: Addressed and resolved complex problems related to dynamic delivery constraints and real-time status updates.
Software Development Lifecycle: Followed a structured approach to software development, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation.
