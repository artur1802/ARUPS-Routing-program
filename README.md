# **AR-UPS Routing Program**

## **Overview**
The **Routing Program** is designed to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for the **AR Service (AR-UPS)** daily local deliveries. This program ensures that all packages are delivered on time while meeting specific delivery requirements and keeping the total distance traveled under 140 miles for all trucks.

## **Features**
- **Custom hash table for managing package data.**
- **Optimized delivery algorithm for route planning.**
- **Command-line interface for real-time package status updates.**
- **Handles dynamic delivery constraints and updates.**

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**

## **How to Run**
To run the program, use the following command in your terminal:

python main.py

## **What I Learned**

Throughout this project, I gained significant experience in the following areas:

- **Algorithm Design: Developed and implemented a delivery routing algorithm that efficiently meets all delivery constraints.**
- **Data Structures: Created a custom hash table to manage and retrieve package data efficiently.**
- **Python Programming: Enhanced my skills in Python, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.**
- **Problem-Solving: Addressed and resolved complex problems related to dynamic delivery constraints and real-time status updates.**
- **Software Development Lifecycle: Followed a structured approach to software development, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation.**
